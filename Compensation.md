### Goal

We'd love the idea that this e-book to become actualized on a regular basis. However, the authors main focus is not necessarily related
to this e-book forever. Thus, the only chance to satisfy this goal is to allow this e-book to be a community-driven one, and motivate arbitrary contributions from Scientists and Engineers for certain compensations proposed below. 

### Conditions  

Who can contribute and what kind of contribution is expected, view [involvement and conditions](https://github.com/Mathemodica/ModelicaPowerSystemBook/blob/main/Involvement.md)

### Acknowledgements and Credits

Depending on the level and nature of the contribution, 
**any contribution shall be acknowledged (acknowledgment section) or credited as a(n) (co-)author (on the top of a section or a chapter).** 

### Academic compensations

The e-book is licenced under typical CC license. Thus, contents of this e-book may act as (an extended) preprint for academic
publications. Therefore, significant contributors 

* can make use of the contents of this e-book for their academic publications. Common ethics for scientific publications are conditioned (agreement of other contributors and relevant credits to their writings) 
* will be qualified to a co-authorship in any relevant academic publication that is making use of thier contribution (given that they
must agree and actively participate in the writing/reviewing of a potential academic publication)  

**Warning** 

Although we'd love to manage an academic publication in the form of communication letter, review paper or other topic-specific 
papers, We don't promise at all that a scientific publication will be ever attempted.

### Organizational / Commerical compensations 

By request, further compensations for those who maintain a contibution ratio of at least 5% of the whole contents (to be anually estimated)   
  - You can bring the logo of your organization to the front of the e-book and/or 
  - You can obtain a ratio of (Y x 0.499) of the whole income of the e-book, where Y: an approximated contribution ratio at least 5% or 10% or 15%, ... (Y is divisable by 5)   
  - ...   

**Warning** 

Current income barely equalizes the current fees of overleaf.com 

**Remark**  

An extended or advanced version of this e-book may (but no promise is made) ends one day as a printed book or a commercial e-book (however, all contributions shall be always made online accessible). We are not really aiming at this goal, but we simply keep this possibility open.
