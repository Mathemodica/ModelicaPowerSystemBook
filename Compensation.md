### Goal

We'd love the idea that this e-book to become actualized on a regular basis. However, the authors main focus is not necessarily related
to this e-book forever. Thus, the only chance to satisfy this goal is to realize this e-book a community driven one, and motivate arbitrary contributions from Scientists and Engineers for certain compensations proposed below. 

### Overleaf.com 

The source of this e-book is available at the online latex editor [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/) enabling collaborative writing currently from a limited number of conbtributors. There are currently some free spots for willing contributors.  

In case you don't have an account on overleaf.com, to this (e-)book benefit's consider creating an account using [this referral link](https://www.overleaf.com?r=e7d83309&rm=d&rs=b). This increases the number of spots for active writers / contributors and meanwhile may reduce the current fees in the future.

### Involvement and contrubutions 

Experts clearly involved in some aspects of the topic of this e-book are welcome to contribute passively (by conducting light reviews, 
topic suggestions, feedback etc.) or actively (by taking apart in the writing, solid read-through reviews, etc.). Depending on the level 
and nature of the contribution, any contribution shall be acknowledged (acknowledgment section) or credited as a(n) (co-)author (on the top of a section or a chapter).

### Academic compensations

The e-book is licenced under typical CC license. Thus, contents of this e-book may act as (an extended) preprint for academic
publications. Therefore, significant contributors 
* can make use of the contents of this e-book for their academic publications. Common ethics for scientific publications are conditioned (agreement and relevant credits to other contributors) 
* will be qualified to a co-authorship in any relevant academic publication that is making use of thier contribution (given that they
must agree and actively participate in the writing/reviewing of a potential academic publication)  

*Warning*: Although we'd love to manage an academic publication in the form of communication letter, review paper or other topic-specific 
papers, We don't promise at all that a scientific publication will be ever attempted.

### Organizational / Commerical compensations 

Further compensations those who maintain a contibution ratio of at least 5% of the whole contents (to be anually estimated)   
  - You can bring the logo of your organization to the front of the e-book 
  - You can obtain a ratio of (Y x 0.499) of the whole income of the e-book, where Y: an approximated contribution ratio at least 5% or 10% or 15%, ... (Y is divisable by 5)   
  - ...   

*Warning*: Current income barely equalizes the current fees of overleaf.com 

*remark*: An extended or advanced version of this e-book may (but not necessarily) ends one day as a printed book or a commercial e-book (however, all contributions shall be always made online accessible). We are not really aiming at this goal, but we simply keep this possibility open.
