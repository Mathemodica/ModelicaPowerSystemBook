If you are involved in power-system related activities using the Modelica language, you are welcome to actively improve 
the state of this (e-)book whenever and/or wherever possible. 

### What kind of contributions are expeccted 

Experts clearly involved in some aspects of the topics underlying this e-book are welcome to contribute to this e-book, passively by

### Main conditions on contributions 

**The contribution has to be in high-quality own-style original text, concise and accurate** 

### General Instructions on contributions 

In order to sustain or improve the quality of this (e-)book, the following general instructions are proposed:

-  It is desired by any contribution to be valuable for educational purpose. 
-  The target scope of readers includes undergraduate students 
-  The target scope of reader includes non-electrical Engineers. However, instead of illustrating basic terminologies, URLs to suggested online introductory materials can be provided, See The first section in [Chapter: Modeling Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355035174_I_Introduction_Ch_2_Modeling_Challenges) 
-  The contents of this (e-)book is partially inspired by many academical papers, however the text is original and rewritten or enhanced in own style. In the same way, we hope provided contributions are also original.
- Similarly, it does not simply make sense to re-copy contents of an open-access paper (or Wikipedia) in this (e-)book. 
Instead, it is more valuable to provide adequate summary in a relevant section with references to a such relevant open-access paper and/or a URL to the library implementation, e.g. [Chapter Relevant Modelica Libraries](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354619412_III_Actual_Aspects_-_Ch_9_Relevant_Modelica_Libraries)
- ... 

### Instructions regarding chapter contributions 

With respect to a whole chapter contribution, the following considerations are proposed: 

The purpose of a chapter contribution should be significant for the (e-)book. For instance, the purpose could include materials not covered by the book s.a.\ (but not limited to) 
- illustrate uncovered concepts and elements of Modelica 
- fundamental power system simulation case studies with which readers will be capable of modeling and simulating their case studies based on the provided illustration or 
- highlight distinguished aspects from relevant Modelica libraries 
- The chapters of the (e-)book are interrelated. Any additional chapter should make use of the information listed in the other chapters or even influence the contents of other chapters
- ... 

### Suggested Enhancements \& Open Questions 

Most chapters are ended with a set of advanced open questions. 
A solid answer to any question may represent a valuable contribution to this (e-)book.
Such an answer may demand not only in-depth understanding of the topic of the question, but also a combination between a careful literature research and creativity in composing a bigger picture from a set of disconnected pieces of information.
