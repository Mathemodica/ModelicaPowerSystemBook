# Modelica by Application: Power Systems 

![Cover](MPSCoverActual.png)

### About 

This is a comprehensive but a concise and educational (e-)book aiming at advertising Modelica-based technologies, particularly useful for power system modeling applications. Whatever aspect that could be relevantly useful has been included,  to the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge and time.  We hope that this (e-)book is useful not only for power system modelers desiring to get a quick idea about the benefits of employing Modelica but also for those Modelica modelers desiring a starting guide into the world of PowerSystems modeling applications.
