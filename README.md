# Modelica by Application: Power Systems 

### About 

This is a comprehensive but a concise and educational (e-)book aiming at advertising Modelica-based technologies, particularly useful for power system modeling applications. Whatever aspect that could be relevantly useful has been included,  to the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge and time.  We hope that this (e-)book is useful not only for powersystem modelers desiring to get a quick idea about the benefits of employing Modelica but also for those Modelica modelers desiring a starting guide into the world of PowerSystems modeling applications.

### Costs 

The e-book is both freely accessible and sponsorable on the basis of pay-as-much-as-you-think the e-book deserves. It is hoped that this e-book becomes a community-driven e-book and remains maintainable and actualized on a regular basis.
